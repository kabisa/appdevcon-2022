# Appdevcon Flutter Workshop

## Getting Started

For this workshop we'll be using Flutter Desktop, to minimize the number of required dependencies.

1. Install Flutter following the [official docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
2. Install the VSCode Flutter plugin (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=vscode)
   OR
   Install Android Studio with the Flutter plugin (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio)

## What are we going to build?

Kudos are compliments that you give your colleguages for excellent work.

Today we want to build a Kudo App with Flutter, so we created a few user stories:

> As a user, I want to see a kudo transaction, so that I display kudos given and received.

> As a user, I want to see a kudo transaction feed, so that I see a list of kudos given.

> As a user, I want to create a kudo transaction form, so that I can enter new kudo transactions.

> As a user, I want to submit a new kudo transaction and show the transaction in the kudo feed, so that I can give kudos to my co-worker.

After the workshop you will be able to:

* Have a general idea about the Dart Language and how to use that with Flutter
* Decipher a mockup into Flutter widgets

Lets Flutter away!
