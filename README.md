# Kudo Flutter Workshop @Kabisa

Building a Kudo App with Dart and Flutter technologie by @pascalw and @thnukid.

## Getting Started

For this workshop we'll be using Flutter Desktop for macOS, to minimize the number of required dependencies.

1. Install XCode
2. Install Flutter from the master channel:
   ```sh
   git clone -b master https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
   ./flutter/bin/flutter doctor -v
   ```
   If setup correctly, the output shows a [âœ“]
3. Optionally, add the Flutter bin directory to your `$PATH`:
   ```sh
   export PATH="/path/to/flutter/repo/bin/:$PATH"
   ```
4. Install the VSCode Flutter plugin (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=vscode)
   OR
   Install Android Studio with the Flutter plugin (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio)

## What are we going to build?

Kudos are compliments that you give your colleguages for excellent work.

Today we want to build a Flutter Kudo App, so we created these user stories:

> As a user, I want to see a kudo transaction, so that I display kudos given and received.

> As a user, I want to see a kudo transaction feed, so that I see a list of kudos given.

> As a user, I want to create a kudo transaction form, so that I can enter new kudo transactions.

> As a user, I want to submit a new kudo transaction and show the transaction in the kudo feed, so that I can give kudos to my co-worker.

After the workshop you will be able to:

* Have a general idea about the Dart Language and how to use that with flutter
* Decipher a mockup into Flutter widgets
* [Give Kudos for the workshop ;)](https://kudos.kabisa.io)

Lets flutter away!
